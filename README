The knobterm Project
--------------------

This project combines an Arduino (2009) board, a small LCD shield [1] and a jog
dial in a small box to create a mini terminal.

The terminal is connected via a virtual serial port over USB to a host system.
It displays the incoming text data on the LCD. User input given by the jog
wheel is reported as serial commands. The terminal also understands a large set
of commands that can be embedded into the text stream. Commands include setting
the text font, color, size, defining windows on screen, positioning the cursor,
showing images and lots more.

The main application of this terminal is to provide a user I/O module for host
system that do not provider any UI. I currently use it for my Raspberry Pi to
provide an easy mechanism for user control. Another application is a status
display on a Home Theatre PC.
